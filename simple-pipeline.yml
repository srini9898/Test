name: My First Pipeline

# When should this pipeline run?
on:
  # Run when code is pushed to the main branch
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  # Also run when someone creates a pull request

    branches: [ main ]

# What jobs should run?
jobs:
  # Job 1: Test our code
  test:
    # Use GitHub's free Ubuntu server
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    # Step 1: Get our code from the repository
    - name: Download our code

    # Step 2: Set up Node.js (if you have a JavaScript project)
    - name: Setup Node.js

      continue-on-error: true
    
    # Step 4: Run tests (if you have any)
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
